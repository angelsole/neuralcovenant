## The Mission

Neural Covenant represents the sacred intersection where ancient wisdom meets modern computation. This blog explores the divine architecture present in both scripture and software, seeking patterns that connect biblical truth with technological innovation.

## The Builder

I'm Angel Sole, a software architect with over 14 years of experience crafting digital solutions. Currently serving as a Full Stack Engineer at Olyx, where we're pioneering sustainable technology in the biofuel brokerage space.

My journey has taken me from CTO roles to hands-on engineering, always guided by the principle that good code, like faith, is built on solid foundations.

### Technical Focus
- Software Architecture & System Design
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Systems
- Distributed Systems & Cloud Infrastructure
- Clean Code & Sustainable Development Practices

### The Integration

As a Catholic and father, I believe technology is a tool for building God's kingdom on Earth. Every line of code is an opportunity to create order from chaos, to serve others, and to reflect the divine pattern of creation itself.

This blog documents my discoveries at the intersection of:
- **Biblical Wisdom**: Timeless principles from scripture
- **Neural Networks**: Modern AI and machine learning
- **Software Craftsmanship**: Building systems that endure
- **Digital Ministry**: Using technology for greater purpose

## The Covenant

The name "Neural Covenant" represents a commitment:
- To build technology that serves humanity
- To seek truth in both code and scripture
- To share knowledge freely, as freely it was given
- To approach innovation with humility and purpose

## Connect

While I share insights here, I'm also building tools that amplify voices across the digital landscape. My content aggregation project helps curate and share valuable insights from across the tech ecosystem.
