## The Builder

I'm Angel Sole, a software architect and engineer with over 14 years of experience crafting digital solutions. Currently serving as a Full Stack Engineer at OLYX in Amsterdam, where I'm building sustainable technology solutions for the biofuel brokerage industry.

My journey through technology has been driven by a deep fascination with how systems work, how they can be improved, and how they can serve humanity better. From my early days working with jQuery and Drupal to architecting serverless ecosystems and leading engineering teams, I've witnessed the incredible evolution of our digital landscape.

## Professional Journey

### Leadership & Architecture
Most recently, I served as CTO at Shimoku (2024), where I led the company's transformation from a product-focused to a service-oriented model. Managing a team that grew from 4 to 9 engineers, I architected comprehensive serverless solutions using AWS CDK, implemented robust CI/CD pipelines, and drove strategic partnerships that increased average client engagement value by over 400%.

### Technical Evolution
My technical foundation spans the full stack:
- **Frontend**: From jQuery to React, Redux to GraphQL, always focusing on performant, accessible interfaces
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS, Express, with expertise in both serverless (Lambda, API Gateway) and containerized architectures
- **Infrastructure**: AWS services (Amplify, CDK, Lambda), Docker, Terraform, and modern DevOps practices
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Redis - choosing the right tool for each use case

### Key Achievements
- Implemented browser-based Python execution for SDK calls at Shimoku, revolutionizing user experience
- Developed Shimoku Playground, a Streamlit competitor for local development
- Transitioned teams from Kanban to Scrum, significantly improving delivery metrics
- Built educational software at Vicens Vives Digital, combining React with Electron for desktop applications

## The Mission

Neural Covenant explores the intersection of technology and deeper meaning. This blog serves as a platform to share insights on:

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Practical applications, architectural patterns, and the future of human-AI collaboration
- **Software Architecture**: Building systems that scale, endure, and serve their purpose elegantly
- **Technical Leadership**: Growing teams, aligning technology with business objectives, and fostering innovation
- **Emerging Technologies**: Exploring new paradigms in computing and their practical applications

## Philosophy

I believe that technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. Every system we build, every line of code we write, should contribute to making the world more connected, more efficient, and more humane. Good architecture isn't just about technical excellence—it's about understanding the human context and building solutions that truly matter.

## Current Focus

- Exploring AI integration patterns with tools like Claude, Cursor AI, and MCP
- Building sustainable, scalable systems in the renewable energy sector
- Contributing to open-source projects that democratize technology
- Writing about the practical challenges and solutions in modern software development

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing technology, architecture, and the future of software development.
